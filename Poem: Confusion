Blindfoled, I walk in the black,
I feel no step but I am not falling,
I flail and touch things but I do not feel.
Have you ever felt numb?
Have you ever fallen while laying in bed?
My eyes are wide open staring, but I don't see anything,
And I hear nothing except the old voice:
"What if this isn't what you wanted?"

Music becomes the only escape--
Dum dadum dum dum DUM.
