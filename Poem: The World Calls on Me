The world calls on me--
The sweetness in the marrow
Left inside the bones 
I have yet to finish.

They told me “never” and I listened,
The good boy that I was,

But now that they’re dead, 
I see that they were broken
And I still receive the calls
From all these sirens of life:
Loves, gods, masks,
Nights dancing to the beat of
Ancestral music,
And all expressions between me and my admirers.

Rest my animals,
Soon we will finally reunite. 
We will write the story,
We will make the adventure,
We will fill our purpose,
And we will walk endlessly 
Into that horizon.
