Tired of the war
Wanna go to sleep
My team's already lost
Trample over my makeshift grave

Sleep is the white cream
That pours out the corner of your eyes
Inescapable
Especially in our eggshelll prisons

Hardwoord sanctuary gives me food
As it sucks away my life

I meet my ghost every morning
I floss it with pain
And brush it with despair

Inside there is nothing

These abysses I have shored against my self
The null filled skyscraper lowers deeper and deeper
